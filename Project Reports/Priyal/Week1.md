# What tasks did I work on / complete?
- As a team we met multiple times this week to decide on the gaming engine, scope(2D/3D), game genre, theme etc. We zeroed down on Unity engine and a 3D game. We discussed pros and cons of following genres: 
1. Shooter based 
    - FPS (First Person Shooter)
    - TPS (Thirs Person Shooter)
2. SSER (Side Scrolling Endless Running)
3. Adventure
4. RPG (Role Playing Games)
5. TPP (Third Parson Perspective)
6. Simulation
7. Sports
8. Strategy
After a lot of discussions and majority voting, we finalised SSER.
Once we were clear about the game genre and search engine, we started discussing theme for the game. All of us came up with few ideas and the candidates were: 
1. Ninja
2. Harry Potter
3. Chhota Bheem
4. Game of Thrones
5. Superman universe
The final theme decided is Game of Thrones as we have a lot of interesting ideas that we can try out in this one.
Next, we did setup our laptops for unity engine. After a quick hands on, we found out that we will have to create tileset for our theme.
Also, we updated tasks on project tracker.

# What am I planning to work on next?
The next task would be to get a good grasp on unity engine and familiarise ourselves with C# language so that we can start on the project implementation. 

# What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
None as of now
