# Courage

## Week-1:

In week one, we need to show courage to come up with the game development ideas and decide the game scope, engine , technology etc. Also, it takes courage to use new tools and technologies that we have never used before. For the game development we chose unity 3D engine that requires knowledge of C# language for scripting. None of us had any prior experience with any of these, but we showed courage and opted for it.
