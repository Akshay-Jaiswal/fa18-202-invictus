# Courage

## Week-1:

In week one, we need to show courage to come up with the game development ideas and decide the game scope, engine , technology etc. Also, it takes courage to use new tools and technologies that we have never used before. For the game development we chose unity 3D engine that requires knowledge of C# language for scripting. None of us had any prior experience with any of these, but we showed courage and opted for it.

## Week-2:

We showed courage in learning unity game engine. We all divided the basic tasks and everyone showed courage in picking up tasks. Showed courage in taking up the tasks that we were not sure about how that will be implemented. Also, updated progress in sprint task sheet which gives fair idea of project progress. As we all are exploring unity and c# for the first time, slow progress in feature delivery is expected in initial weeks, we showed courage and admitted that. As after second week, we feel more confident about the game, we are sure to deliver a working game with basic functionalities in next week.

## Week-3:

We were working with 2D character images and simple player object in our game. This week, we decided to change that and use 3D character which required brainstorming on 3D character features. We showed courage and explored the 3D feature set and animations that we could apply in our game. It takes courage to change the working implementation to provide valuable features. We also reviewed the design and refactored the code to keep the design more flexible with applicable patterns. Since all of us are working on separate tasks, understanding of modules sometimes differ from person to person and at this situation we need to show courage to ask for help and admit that we do not know everything. We followed this principle throughtout the developemnt, it helped us in learning from each others's experience and at the same time delivering better features in lesser time.

## Week-4:

Having done with 3D characters, the next challenging task was to take up the leaderboard functionality. Since it's the last week for implementation, it put a lot of pressure on us to add new valuable feature in game which can enhance user experience. It takes courage to work under pressure and deliver fruitful feature on time. Throughout the scrum, we had our sprint task sheet and project tracker transparent, which give us a fair idea about how far we are from our goal. We also showed courage in testing and fixing out the bugs in game.
