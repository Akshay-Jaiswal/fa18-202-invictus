# Courage

## Week-1:

Communication is the key for the proper functioning of any team. Various ways of communication were used in our project.
First of all, we created a Whatsapp group for proper communication among each and every member of the team. Also we 
had face-to-face communication by arranging various meetings. The meetings helped us to gain the perspective of the team on a number of game ideas.
For techinical discussions viz. sharing important links, articles and videos we created a channel on Slack.
We plan to continue the same for all the future discussions.

## Week-2:

- As we have now decided on the Game idea, we invested our time in getting to know the different technologies involved.
- Also, from all the resources available to us, we filtered out the important and most useful ones.
- The link to this information was shared on the Slack channel by each team member according to his/her findings.
- We discussed about the division of workload, manner of commits to be made on Github and the progress each one made throughout the week.
- Communicating with each other to know the progress made by every team member gave us an idea about the progress of the game as a whole and an estimate about the timely completion of the project.

## Week-3:

- As we have started implementing our individual tasks, communication is the key in knowing and handling the dependencies between the code instances of the team members.
- All the team members communicated with each other to know the various individual components in the project.
- Next, we found out the areas of overlap and the amount of work to be done by each person in such cases.
- Also, we communicated among oursleves to decide various design patterns to be implemented and took each other's feedback for the same.
- Due to proper communication among ourselves, we could ensure development of quality code.
