# Courage

## Week-1:

Communication is the key for the proper functioning of any team. Various ways of communication were used in our project.
First of all, we created a Whatsapp group for proper communication among each and every member of the team. Also we 
had face-to-face communication by arranging various meetings. The meetings helped us to gain the perspective of the team on a number of game ideas.
For techinical discussions viz. sharing important links, articles and videos we created a channel on Slack.
We plan to continue the same for all the future discussions.
