# Courage

## Week-1:

Game development was an area of software development that none of us has ever worked in so when it came to working on our first game we were overwhelmed by the choices we had and the complexity that came with it while choosing the right first game and tools to build it. As a team we decided that Simplicity of the project is of utmost important for us. But the One thing about simple designs is that they require knowledge to recognize them. We had the choice of choosing between a tool where we had to design each and everything from scratch and a tool where we could use built in features to facilitate the game development. Since the primary goal of the project was to learn to apply deisgn patterns and not learn to make a game from scratch, we chose the later tool which gave the built in funtionality. This way we imbraced simplicity in our project.

## Week-2:

Unity game engine is one of the most popular gaming engines. It has a very intricate set of functionalities which can take yars to master. For this project we had to deliver a game within 4 weeks and implement design patterns so that our game will pas the TUBE test i.e. the game had to be Testable, Understandable, Browsable, and Explainable. Keeping Simplicity in mind we narrowed down the features we needed to implement and started learning only the parts of Unity we needed. As after second week, we feel more confident about the game and we are going to add more features as we go on.
