# Courage

## Week-1:

In week one, we need to show courage to come up with the game development ideas and decide the game scope, engine , technology etc. Also, it takes courage to use new tools and technologies that we have never used before. For the game development we chose unity 3D engine that requires knowledge of C# language for scripting. None of us had any prior experience with any of these, but we showed courage and opted for it.

## Week-2:

We showed courage in learning unity game engine. We all divided the basic tasks and everyone showed courage in picking up tasks. Showed courage in taking up the tasks that we were not sure about how that will be implemented. Also, updated progress in sprint task sheet which gives fair idea of project progress. As we all are exploring unity and c# for the first time, slow progress in feature delivery is expected in initial weeks, we showed courage and admitted that. As after second week, we feel more confident about the game, we are sure to deliver a working game with basic functionalities in next week.
